• Performed Nodal analysis using IPR and TPR models to optimize bottom-hole pressure and flow rate in an oil well. 

• Simulated inflow and outflow performance based on well data to calculate operational bottom-hole pressure and 
flow rate, analyzing the effect of tubing diameter on frictional pressure loss. 

• Revealed that increasing tubing diameter reduces frictional pressure loss, resulting in a higher stable flow rate.
